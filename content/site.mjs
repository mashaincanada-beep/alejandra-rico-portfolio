  about: [
    'I am an advertising professional and graphic designer from Cali, Colombia. For five years I designed for public, institutional and political communication: books and newspapers, brand identities, social campaigns, video and print for the street.',

I bring strategic thinking from advertising together with hands on design and video editing.',
    'I am currently completing a Master of Arts in Digital Media and Global Communications at University of Niagara Falls Canada, and I am growing toward art direction.',
